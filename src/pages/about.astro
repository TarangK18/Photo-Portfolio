            Hello! I'm a passionate photographer 
            capturing life's most beautiful moments. My journey in photography
            began when I first picked up a camera at the age of 16.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-primary-700">
            I specialize in landscape, portrait, and urban photography. My work
            has been featured in various exhibitions and publications around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-primary-700">
            When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me exploring new
            locations, teaching photography workshops, or working on personal
            projects.
